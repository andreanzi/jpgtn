It is a pleasure to announce that jpgtn 2.00 is now available to the public.

I decided that jpgtn should get a rebirth because of another birth. . . that 
of my beautiful daughter, Courtney Elizabeth, who was born on April 18, 2002!

By early June, I had already collected several hundred digital photos of her
but had not yet made most of them available to my family. I decided I should
put up a website. I pulled out jpgtn-1.04 to make thumbnails for the website
and found that an old bug prevented jpgtn from processing photos produced by
my digicam. Right then and there I started hacking on the code for the first
time in about three years. 

Out of curiosity, I searched around on the web and found that there several 
hundred references to this little utility out there. I was pleased to see it
had gained a small following among the PHP crowd. There were also many sites 
on which I found images named with the telltale "tn_" prefix that jpgtn uses
as its default prefix. (I understand, of course, that by itself that doesn't 
mean much, but figured it was safe to assume that at least some of them were
created with jpgtn.)

Inspired by the evidence that it is being used, I went ahead and cleaned it
up even more. I fixed another bug or three and changed some of the behavior
I didn't care for (such as removing the warning when no prefix or directory
was supplied.) I have increased the maximum output image size and decreased
the minimum because I felt they were both arbitrary. The interface has been
changed somewhat during this update. Now the -v switch(es) are used to vary
the verbosity level and the -V switch displays the version information. The
-f switch is now required before jpgtn will overwrite existing output files
and the -p switch behaves sanely when the filename arguments have paths. To
get something close to the old behavior, use one -v switch and a -f switch.
