Version 1.01 --
    Fixed bug which caused SIGSEGV during batch mode operation. This was due
    to a source code mix up... sorry everyone. I guess I should be using RCS.

Version 1.02 --
    Due to a heads-up from Terry Mackintosh:
    Added the compile-time -DOLD_SONY_DIGICAM option so that jpgtn can
    recognize data produced by a Sony MVC-FD7 digital camera. I don't know if 
    other similar problems exist with other digicams. I do know that the 
    MVC-FD71 does produce JFIF images. If you have information on other 
    digicams which don't produce JFIF, please send me email with the make and 
    model of the camera, and, if possible, some pictures taken with it. My 
    email address is: jdmadea@cs.millersv.edu

Version 1.03 --
    Due to a suggestion by Terry Mackintosh:
    Added -H and -W options to allow resizing on one dimension letting the 
    other one to float. Eg. Assuming foo.jpg is 480x640, the command:

    bash$ jpgtn -H -s 48 foo.jpg

    will produce a thumbnail that is 64x48, and the command:

    bash$ jpgtn -W -s 48 foo.jpg

    will produce a thumbnail that is 48x36. The default (no -H or -W option) 
    results in the original behavior, i.e. the image is resized to fit in 
    an NxN box where N is the argument to the -s switch. Basically, the default
    just chooses -H if the height is the longer dimension and -W if the width
    is.

Version 1.04 --
    Changed MINSIZE (in jpgtn.h) to be 24 instead of 50. I often need small 
    thumbnails for myself, and changed this long ago in my personal copy...
    I just couldn't see any reason not to change it in the distribution.

    Wow. three years later and I finally get around to doing some much needed
    maintenance. Talk about slacking. :-) Cleaned a lot up. Fixed the issue
    with not being able to recognize some jpeg formats (hopefully for good) 
    by removing the whole imagetype.c source file. It was left over from 
    gtnpic which handled more than one image format. jpgtn just works with 
    jpegs so it wasn't at all helpful anyway; even worse, it was buggy. This 
    was the proper fix for that old problem with sony digicams.

    Fixed poor filename handling semantics. Now we ignore all path information
    on input files when constructing output files. All output files either get
    dumped into the current directory or the directory specified with the -d 
    switch. Previously, something like "jpgtn ./foo.jpg" would result in an 
    error because it tried to prepend the default prefix to the whole path as 
    supplied and "./tn_./foo.jpg" would fail in the absence of a directory name     "tn_.".

Version 2.00 -- 
    Changed minimum size to 2 pixels. I don't know what the use of that
    would be but I didn't see the point of an arbitrary minimum of 24 pixels. 
    I would have changed it to 1 pixel but doing so results in an error. I'll 
    look into that later. Changed maximum size to 2048 pixels. Such an image 
    size could hardly be called a thumbnail but, again, I didn't see the point 
    of an arbitrary maximum of 256 pixels. Now I can use jpgtn to convert all
    of my 2048x1536 images to 640x480.

    Added -f flag which is now required in order to overwrite existing files. 
    Changed the version flag to be -V instead of -v which is now used for...
    Added -v flag which may be used more than once for increasing levels of 
    verbosity. Removed warning that used to be written when no prefix or 
    directory was supplied. Removed the prepending of "./" onto files when no 
    directory was supplied. Kludged around rare 0 value for width or height. 

[Fri Jun 14 17:01:58 PDT 2002]
    Renamed usage() and version() to print_usage() and print_version() 
    respectively. Cleaned up several non-source files including the man
    page. Released to sunsite.unc.edu. 


[Sun Jun 23 12:25:01 PDT 2002]
    Fixed a bug whereby I was neglecting to initialize the variable holding 
    the output filename.
