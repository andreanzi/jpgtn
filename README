                              ===============
 
  What is jpgtn?
  --------------
 
  Jpgtn is a thumbnailer for JPEG images. 

  Jpgtn is based on "tnpic" by Russell Marks and on "gtnpic" by Willie
  Daniel. "tnpic" was originally distributed as a utility with Marks' "zgv"
  program. "gtnpic" was an attempt to clean up and expand upon the original 
  tnpic program and "maybe add some new features along the way." Jpgtn 
  differs from both tnpic and gtnpic in purpose. It is not an indexer.

  Jpgtn only thumbnails JPEG images. I have no plans to change it to accept 
  other input formats. On and off I've thought about adding support for PNG 
  output but I haven't had a real need for it myself so I haven't done it. 

  Jpgtn can output thumbnails to files with names based on the names of the 
  input files, or it can dump to stdout. The stdout support can be a useful
  feature for CGI applications.

  Jpgtn is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.



  What do I need to use it?
  -------------------------

  In order to compile the source distribution you will need a C compiler. 

  You will also need the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library, libjpeg. 
  It is a common library and it may already be installed on your system. 
  If you don't have libjpeg, it is freely available and links to the source 
  and documentation can be found on the Independent JPEG Group's page at 
  http://www.ijg.org/.
