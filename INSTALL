Preface
=======

  Jpgtn now uses a GNU autoconf/automake driven build process. This is new
  and I've only tested it on Solaris (7 & 8) and Red Hat Linux 8.0. I want
  to hear your feedback.  Please, send it to jpgtn@madea.net.

  Thanks!

Basic Installation
==================

  Now that jpgtn comes with one of those ubiquitous "configure" scripts, 
  the recommended way to build it is with the usual: 

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  The configure script takes the usual options for choosing installation 
  directories and such. The only custom option is: --with-libjpeg=PATH to 
  specify the location of libjpeg and its headers. If, for instance, you 
  have libjpeg.a in /home/user/lib and jpeglib.h in /home/user/lib you 
  would run the configure script like so: 

      ./configure --with-libjpeg=/home/user

  For more information about the other options that are supported by 
  configure just type:

      ./configure --help


Setting the Environment 
=======================

  In some cases you might find it necessary to specify some odd options 
  by hand.  You can often do this by setting some environment variables 
  manually. As an example, consider a case where your jpeglib.h header 
  file is in a really weird place. . . This might help if you are using 
  a Bourne compatible shell: 

      CPPFLAGS=-I/some/really/weird/place ./configure


Changing the Build Directory
============================

  If you want, you can compile jpgtn in a build directory of your choice 
  as long as your version of make supports the VPATH variable. GNU make 
  will work.  To do this, you simply `cd` to the directory where you 
  want to build the package and run the provided configure script from 
  there. The object files and the executable will actually be created in 
  a subdirectory called "src/" in the build directory you have chosen.
